Our vision is to immerse the user into a virtual game inspired by real life, where experience points (XP) is obtained for what you do in the real world. 

The inclusion of quests makes this app unlike anything else on the market. In a quest, users can follow a series of instructions, which include checking in to a series of locations near the user. XP is awarded to a user who completes a give quest. 

We envision this application to be used by businesses and users. Businesses will have the capability to award extra experience points to users for visting their business. End Users can organize hosted events and award XP for all event attendees. 

Ultimately, our application aims to encourage all users to discover new places and be rewarded for their travels and unique experiences.
